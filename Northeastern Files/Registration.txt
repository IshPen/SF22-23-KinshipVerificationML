6 July 2020 (v 0.2.0)

RFIW 2020 (https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/rfiw2020/), held as an IEEE FG Challenge, is made up of 3 tasks. Specifically, kinship verification (T-1), Tri-Subject Verification (T-2), and Search & Retrieval (T-3). For this, Family IDs are split into 3 sets (i.e., train, val, and test). Train and val were provided for development purposes, while the test was reserved for "blind" evaluation. Now, data and labels are provided for each. As reported in the white paper (downloadable via https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06303 or https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/fg/2020/307900a877/1kecJ3M0dZC), the test set is used to report the final performance. Thus, both train and validation are designated for training the final models deployed for evaluating the test set.

Here we provide downloadable links for each task, along with links to learn more about the tasks (i.e., as reported in white paper pointed to above):
